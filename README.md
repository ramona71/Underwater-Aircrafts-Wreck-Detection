AerialWrecks â€” YOLOv7 for High-Resolution Sidescan Sonar Aircraft-Wreck Detection

Short description:
DeepSonar-AerialWrecks is a deep-learning pipeline built with YOLOv7 to accelerate discovery of WWII aircraft wreckage in high-resolution sidescan sonar imagery. The project was trained on the largest public aircraft-wreck focused dataset to date (19 unique wrecks, 290 fragments across six countries). The trained model achieves an F1 score of 0.74 and in field tests correctly identified 3 of 4 previously unknown aircraft.

This repository contains code, training/inference recipes, evaluation scripts, and a recommended human-in-the-loop workflow for deploying the model in field operations.
